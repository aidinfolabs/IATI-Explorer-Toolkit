IATI Data Explorer
==================

==== Set Up ====
Make sure the cache directories are writable by your web server. 

Requires: PHP5 with XSL. 

==== License ====
To be confirmed. Open.

==== To Do ====
Code needs a lot of refactoring to be tidier.

Right now quite a bit is tied to DFID specific implementation. As new IATI data becomes available this should be generalised.

In the long run, given the size of files to be dealt with, we're likely to need to use the server side features coming in Exhibit 3. 

No clean-up for the cache is implemented at present, so you may want to set up a cron job to clear at least the JSON cache directory regularly.
