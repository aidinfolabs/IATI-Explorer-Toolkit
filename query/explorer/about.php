<p>
	The IATI Explorer uses the <a href="http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit/" title="Simile Exhibit">browser-based Exhibit tool</a> to provide a view onto <a href="http://iatiregistry.org/">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> data from the range of donor agencies publishing using the <a href="http://aidtransparency.net">IATI Standard</a>.
 </p>
<p>
	The explorer allows you to select a sub-set of IATI data to load up in your browser where you can then further filter and browse the data with a faceted browsing interface. You can view a full profile of each project, and explore data in timeline, tabular and map forms. 
</p>
<p>
	This is an experimental tool, and due to differences in the data available from different donors, and the different ways donors may represent their data at present, there are a number of issues that may affect the presentation of data and the functioning of this app. This tool requires a modern web browser (Firefox; Chrome or Internet Explorer 7 and above) and makes extensive use of Javascript. Alternative access to IATI Data is linked below.
